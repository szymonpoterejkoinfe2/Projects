Notice that what is considered a letter depends on the locale being used; In the default "C" locale, what constitutes a letter is only what returns true by either isupper or islower.
Using other locales, an alphabetic character is a character for which isupper or islower would return true, or another character explicitly considered alphabetic by the locale (in this case, the character cannot be iscntrl, isdigit, ispunct or isspace).
