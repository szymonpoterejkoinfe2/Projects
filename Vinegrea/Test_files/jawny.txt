round—more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow
Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me;
but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I
couldn’t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my
sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he
hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and
I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So
I went back.
The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and
she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm
by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old
thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you
had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go
right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her
head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn’t really
anything the matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything
was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different;
things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the
things go better.
After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and
the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by
and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long
time; so then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take
no stock in dead people.
Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But
she wouldn’t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I
must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people.
They get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it.
Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and
no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault
with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took
snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.
Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on 
had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a
spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and
then the widow made her ease up. I couldn’t stood it much longer.
Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson
would say, “Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t
scrunch up like that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty soon
she would say, “Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry—why
don’t you try to behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place,
and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean
no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a
change, I warn’t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said;
said she wouldn’t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so
as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going
where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. But
I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do
no good.
Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the
good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go
around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn’t
think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom
Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I
was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.
Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and
then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of
candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the
window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no
use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I
heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was
dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was
going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me,
and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers
run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a
sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something
that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so can’t rest
