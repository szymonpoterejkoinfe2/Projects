edgar (or eadgar;[1] 943/944  – 8 july 975) was king of england from 959 until his death in 975. he was the younger son of king edmund i and his first wife Ælfgifu. edmund was killed in 946 trying to protect his seneschal from attack by an outlaw, and because his children were infants he was succeeded by his younger brother eadred, who died in 955. edgar's older brother, eadwig then became king and in 957 the kingdom was divided, with eadwig ruling south of the thames and edgar north of it. historians disagree whether this was the result of a revolt by edgar's supporters against eadwig's incompetent rule or a previously agreed division. edgar became king of all england on his brother's death in 959. a chronological account of edgar's reign is not possible, because only a few events were recorded by chroniclers and monastic writers were more interested in recording the activities of the leaders of the church.
